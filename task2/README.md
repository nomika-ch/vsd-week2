# Overview
The **VSDBabySoC** is a simple SoC (System-on-Chip) design incorporating a RISC-V processor (rvmyth), a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) module (pll), and a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) module (dac). This project demonstrates integration of these IP cores and aims to simulate and verify the design behavior using pre-synthesis and post-synthesis simulations.
